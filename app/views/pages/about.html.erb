        <p>  Hi, I'm Kyla Tingey. I am currently a student at the Bottega School of Technology bootcamp, studying to become a web-program developer. Before Bottega, I studied at both East Valley Insitute of Technology and Mesa Community College. Through EVIT, I became a Certified Nursing Assistant and Dental Assistant. I have also been certified to take dental radiographs. I enjoy learning new things and having a broad range of knowledge. </p>
